This contains important notes made from the SAS Certification Prep Guide: Base Programming for SAS 9, 3rd edition

General form of a SAS code:

DATA output-SAS-dataset(DROP = variables|KEEP = variables) *DROP & KEEP are mutually exclusive;
SET dataset <options>;
BY variable(s);
RUN;

CHAPTER 1: BASE PROGRAMMING

SAS programs can be used to access,manage,analyze & present your data. 

SAMPLE PROGRAM: 
data sasuser.admit2; 
set sasuser.admit; 
where age>39; 
run; 
proc print data=sasuser.admit2; 
run;

This contains 2 steps: PROC step & DATA step. A SAS program can consist of a SAS step, a PROC step or any number of SAS/PROC steps.

General difference between DATA step & PROC step:

DATA step is used to typically create or modify datasets. They can also be used to make custom designed reports.
PROC steps invoke or call pre-written routines that enable to process & analyze the dataset.

Characteristics of a SAS program:
1. A SAS statement usually begins with a keyword
2. A SAS statement always ends with a semicolon

Layout for a SAS program:
