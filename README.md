# Hello-Programming
My introduction to the programming world

This file shall mark my inroads into the world of programming. I have a minimal knowledge about a few languages out there but no real depth in any of them. By documenting this, I create a tangible target for me. I will set out 1:30 hour a day to learn a programming language & hopefully will learn enough.
